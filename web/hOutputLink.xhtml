        <h1>Welcome the the H:OutputLink Web Page</h1>
        Here are some facts about H:OutputLinkss,
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Uses a value attribute, but does not have an outcome attribute. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The value attribute in this one, instead of it being the text that the user sees, 
        it is instead the URL in which you want the user to be sent too.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Since the value attribute is used to send the person to another page, you have to write between 
        the opening and closing tags what the user will see. This technique is used more in HTML.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If the value attribute is not there, when clicked on it will use the current pages URL. 
        The use of an h:output link is useful because it does not require you to interact with the JSF program 
        itself.
