        <h1>Welcome the the H:Link Web Page</h1>
        Here are some facts about H:Links,
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Uses both a value and an outcome attribute. Can also use other attributes as well.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The value attribute is used for what you want the user to be able to click on,
        before the text from before was H:Link.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The outcome attribute is used for what target URL you want the user to be sent too,
        the target URL for this page is hLink.xhtml. Using a JSF it is much easier to get to your
        target destination than having to write it down in a normal a:link tag.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Links should be used to talk to controllers and have them take you to the next page, 
        instead of talking directly with the next page. In these demos I just talk with another page.
        Using of a H:link tag is good for interacting with other JSF pages, however it is more difficult 
        to use on dynamic pages.
